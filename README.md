# Linear Regression Model Training App

This project is a **Streamlit** application that allows users to upload a CSV file, select variables, and train a linear regression model. The app provides an easy-to-use interface for selecting dependent and independent variables, scaling data, applying polynomial regression, and evaluating model performance.

Check the project: https://linear-regression-training-app.streamlit.app/
## Features

- **CSV File Upload**: Upload your dataset directly through the app.
- **Variable Selection**: Choose the dependent and independent variables for model training.
- **Data Scaling**: Automatically scales the independent variables.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Option to apply polynomial regression with a selectable degree.
- **Model Training**: Trains a linear regression model and provides predictions.
- **Performance Metrics**: Displays RÂ², MAE, RMSE, and MSE for evaluating the model.
- **Variable Impact**: Displays the impact of each independent variable on the model.

## Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main script for running the Streamlit application.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository**:
